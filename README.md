# -Pose-and-Facial-Expression-Recognition-at-Multiple-Yaw-Angles
A program designed to recognize the yaw angles of 0°, 45° and 90°; and the expressions (happy, sad, disgust, fear, anger, surprised) of non- frontal faces. 

A software system which takes an image of human face as an input and gives the expression on the face as output using different approaches and compare them. The input image may or may not be a frontal view of the face. It may be an image captured at an angle between that of profile view and front view. The output given by the system must be one of the following: happy, surprise, anger, fear, sad and disgust. Two variants of LBPs for facial expression recognition have been considered for using non-frontal facial images namely LGBP and DCLBP
